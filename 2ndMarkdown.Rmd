Monty Hall asks you to choose one of three doors. Behind one door is a car, while behind the other doors are goats. Keep in mind Monty knows what's behind each door. Let's say you pick _Door #1_, but you don't open it right away. Monty opens _Door #3_, which has a goat.

You are now given the chance to switch doors. **Is it to your advantage to switch doors?**

### __Insights__

Ivan: After initially reading the problem, I was inclined to answer that switching doors would not give any advantage to winning the car. Since two doors remained, it was only a 50-50 chance to win the car or the goat. However, this was a mistake because I did not consider the first part of initially choosing among the three doors.
