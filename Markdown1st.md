### 1. Aside from the reasons mentioned in class, why do we need to study and analyze data?

-   It is important to study and analyze data since everything around
    us—the things we see, smell, feel, hear, taste—are all considered as
    kinds of data. These pieces of information that we often collect and
    interpret in our day-to-day lives can not only help us, but also
    other people and for the future generations to come. Data is also
    known to be one of the foundations of research. Through data and
    research, we are able to answer relevant questions and make better
    decisions.

### 2. Cite atleast one instance or application where data science was used and contributed on policy-making, day-to-day decisions, knowing market trends, and scientific researches.

-   One instance or application where data science is used is the
    prediction of diseases. Data regarding patients or previous history
    or variants of diseases have been used to predict the presence of a
    disease in a person. Data science has helped humanity detect
    diseases much faster to be able to prevent the worsening of a
    person’s condition.

### 3. Propose atleast one data science topic that you want to pursue: Have a broad description of the topic, describe the availability of the data, what kinds of statistical method you think you will need, and who would benefit this study.

| Topic                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Availability of Data                                                                                                                                                                   | Statistical Method  | Beneficiary                                                           |

| Social Media Analytics | Now that we are in a digital age, social media has been a major part of our lives. Social media is now always being intersected with data science . This data can be used to support marketing strategies, know the effectivity of campaigns, and to personalize advertisements and content. If I were to propose a particular study, I would want to dwell on the analysis of K-pop fans using Twitter Analytics. I have not yet thought of the specifics that I want to dwell on, but I wanted to relate my study to K-pop since I personally use Twitter as a medium to interact with other K-pop fans like me. | The availablity of data for this is vast. The data comes from what social media users publicly share. Some examples of these data are the user’s location, shared links, and searches. | Statistical method: | The beneficiaries of the study would be social media content creators |
